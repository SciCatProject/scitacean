class LinkFileTransfer:
    """Upload / download files by creating symlinks.

    This file transfer does not actually upload or download files.
    Instead, it requires that the 'remote' file system is directly
    accessible from the 'local' file system.
    It creates symlinks in the local download folder to the
    'remote' files.

    Note
    ----
    A note on terminology:
    In Scitacean, 'remote' refers to the file server where the data files
    are stored that belong to SciCat datasets.
    In contrast, 'local' refers to the file system of the machine that
    runs the Python process.
    The two filesystems can be the same.
    However, Scitacean maintains a strict separation between the two and
    uses 'downloaders' and 'uploaders' to transfer between them even if that
    transfer is a simple symlink.

    See also the documentation of :class:`scitacean.File`.

    Warning
    -------
    This file transfer does not work on Windows.
    This is due to :class:`RemotePath` not supporting backslashes as
    path separators.
    In practice, this should not be a problem because SciCat file storage
    should never be a Windows server.

    Warning
    -------
    This file transfer cannot upload files.
    Instead, consider copying or moving the files to the SciCat source folder
    or writing the files there directly from your workflow.

    Attempting to upload files will raise ``NotImplementedError``.

    Examples
    --------
    Given a dataset with ``source_folder="/dataset/source"`` and a file with path
    ``"file1.dat"``, this

    .. code-block:: python

        client = Client.from_token(
            url="...",

            file_transfer=LinkFileTransfer()
        )
        ds = client.get_dataset(pid="...")
        ds = client.download_files(ds, target="/downloads")
