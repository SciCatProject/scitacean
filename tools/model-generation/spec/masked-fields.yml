# Fields listed here are omitted from models and silently dropped during download.
# Fields can either be a string in which case it is dropped both for
# upload and download or a dict mapping onto either "upload" or "download" to select
# what model to mask it in.
# Field names must be SciCat names (camelCase).
Dataset:
  - history  # because history is dropped (see field-validations.yml)
  - datasetlifecycle: upload
