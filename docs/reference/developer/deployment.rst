Documentation on Github Pages
-----------------------------

TODO

The procedure below describes the steps to follow in order to publish documentation pages from a new repository in the SciCatProject organisation to the scipp.github.io website.

In this example, we assume that the new repository is named ``ess`` (the full path including organisation is hence ``scipp/ess``).

All documentation must go in a ``docs`` folder located at the root of the repository.
We use ``sphinx`` (and ``nbsphinx``) to transform ``.rst`` files and Jupyter notebooks into html pages.


#. Clone the ``ess`` repository: ``git clone git@github.com:scipp/ess.git``

#. Create a `gh-pages` branch on the repository with ``git checkout -b gh-pages``

#. On Github, go to the repository ``Settings > Pages`` (you will need admin rights to see the ``Settings`` tab). You should see that it is now saying "Your site is published at ``https://scipp.github.io/ess/``". It should also be saying it is using the ``gh-pages`` branch and the ``/root`` folder.

#. On your local machine, generate a ssh key, without an email or passphrase: ``ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096``. When prompted for a file name, use ``gh_pages_deploy_key``.

#. Go to the repository's ``Settings > Deploy keys``. Add a new key, and copy the contents of the ``gh_pages_deploy_key.pub`` file. Remember to also give the key ``write`` access to the repository.

#. Go to the project page on Azure. Go to ``Pipelines > Library``. Open the Variable Group named ``tokens`` if it already exists, if not create one.

#. Copy/paste the contents of the ``gh_pages_deploy_key.pub`` file into a new secret variable named ``gh_pages_deploy_key_public``.

#. Still in the Azure project's library, go to ``Pipelines > Library > Secure Files``. Upload the ``gh_pages_deploy_key`` (the private key of the pair without the ``.pub``) file as a secure file.

#. On your local machine, to back to where you cloned the ``ess`` git repository. Create a new branch starting from the ``main`` branch: ``git checkout main`` then ``git checkout -b deploy_docs``.

#. In that new branch, enable docs deployment in the ``.azure-pipelines/main.yml`` and ``.azure-pipelines/release.yml`` files, by simply setting ``deploy: true``.

#. Push the changes to github (``git push origin deploy_docs``) and create a pull request. Hopefully, once the pull request is merged into ``main`` the pages will show up on `https://scipp.github.io/ess <https://scipp.github.io/ess>`_.

.. note::
  An alternative to this last step is, instead of waiting for the PR to be merged, one can just change the "branches trigger" in the ``main.yml`` and at the same time disable publishing of new packages as a temporary change.
