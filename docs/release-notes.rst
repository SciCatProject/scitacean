---------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Added :func:`scitacean.Dataset.as_new` and :func:`scitacean.Dataset.derive`.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``remote_base_path`` argument of ``SSHFileTransfer`` has been replaced with ``source_folder`` which may now contain format specifiers.
* ``Dataset.investigator`` is no longer required to be an email address as this does not match common usage.
* For raw datasets, ``Dataset.investigator`` has been replaced with ``Dataset.principal_investigator`` to match the names in SciCat.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Removed ``Dataset.instrument_id`` for derived datasets.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Document how file transfers interact with source folders.

Breaking changes
