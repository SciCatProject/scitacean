Getting started
===============

Setting up
----------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Development dependencies are specified in ``requirements/dev.txt`` and can be installed using (see `Dependency Management <./dependency-management.rst>`_ for more information)

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

Additionally, building the documentation requires `pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>`_ which is not on PyPI and needs to be installed through other means.
(E.g. with your OS package manager.)

If you want to run tests against a real backend or SSH server, you also need ``docker-compose``.
See `Testing <./testing.rst>`_ for what this is good for and why.

Install the package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the package in editable mode using

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install -e .

Set up git hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CI pipeline runs a number of code formatting and static analysis tools.
If they fail, a build is rejected.
To avoid that, you can run the same tools locally.
This can be done conveniently using `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_:

.. code-block:: sh

    pre-commit install

Alternatively, if you want a different workflow, take a look at ``tox.ini`` or ``.pre-commit.yaml`` to see what tools are run and how.

Running tests
-------------


.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Manually

        Run the tests using

        .. code-block:: sh

            python -m pytest -n<number-of-threads>

        Or to run tests against a real backend and SSH server (see setup above)


        .. code-block:: sh

            pytest --backend-tests --sftp-tests

        Note that the setup and teardown of the backend takes several seconds.

    .. tab-item:: tox

        Run the tests using (e.g. python 3.10)

        .. code-block:: sh

            tox -e py310

        Or to also run backend and SFTP tests use

        .. code-block:: sh

            tox -e py310-full

Building the docs
-----------------

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Manually

        Build the documentation using

        .. code-block:: sh

            python -m sphinx -v -b html -d build/.doctrees docs build/html

        Additionally, test the documentation using

        .. code-block:: sh

            python -m sphinx -v -b doctest -d build/.doctrees docs build/html
            python -m sphinx -v -b linkcheck -d build/.doctrees docs build/html

    .. tab-item:: tox

        Build the documentation using

        .. code-block:: sh

            tox -e docs

        This both builds the docs and runs ``docstest`` and ``linkcheck``.
