    "Scitacean provides two way to help with this, tools for deploying servers on the local machine as well as fakes to perform tests without any actual servers. This guide describes both methods.\n",

    "That is `FakeClient` handles metadata and `FakeFileTransfer` handles files.\n",
    "They can be mixed and matched freely with the real client and file transfers.\n",
    "But it is generally recommended to combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, SciCat servers and fileservers are managed by the [scicat_backend](../generated/modules/scitacean.testing.backend.fixtures.scicat_backend.rst) and [sftp_fileserver](../generated/modules/scitacean.testing.sftp.fixtures.sftp_fileserver.rst) pytest fixtures.\n",
